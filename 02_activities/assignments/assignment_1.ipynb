    "#The purpose of the is_duplicate function is to locate the binary tree's first duplicate integer. Beginning at the top of the tree, it goes through every number (or node) one by one. It uses a set to keep track of the numbers it has already seen while it examines each one. In this manner, it can recognize a duplication when it comes across a number it has already seen. As soon as it finds and returns the first duplicate number, the function ends. It returns -1 if, after verifying every number in the tree, no duplicates are discovered. With this method, the function's performance is mostly determined by the number of nodes in the tree, ensuring that it functions effectively even for big trees."

In this manner, it may identify a duplicate if it comes across a number it has already seen. As soon as it locates and returns the first duplicate number, the function ends. The function returns a special value (-1) if there are no duplicates. Because it only examines each number once and utilizes memory proportionate to the number of numbers in the tree, this approach is effective for trees of any size."
