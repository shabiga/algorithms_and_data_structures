    "#In tackling Assignment 1, I engaged deeply with the problem of identifying missing numbers within a specified range from a list of integers. Initially, my focus was on deciphering the problem constraints, particularly handling duplicates and efficiently determining absent numbers. Opting for Python's set data structure was a strategic choice due to its O(1) average-time complexity for membership checks and set operations like differences. Implementing the solution involved iterating through the list to populate sets of expected and actual numbers, followed by computing the difference to identify missing numbers or returning -1 if none were found. This method proved robust, ensuring accuracy and scalability across various input sizes.\n",

    "#During the presentation and review session with my partner, we engaged in a fruitful discussion on different approaches to solving the problem. We explored edge cases and considered optimizations, exchanging ideas that enhanced our understanding of set operations and algorithmic efficiency. Comparing my approach with my partner's solution underscored the importance of clarity in code structure and handling diverse input scenarios. This collaboration not only deepened my grasp of Python's set functionalities but also reinforced the value of collaborative problem-solving and peer feedback in refining solutions for clarity and performance."
